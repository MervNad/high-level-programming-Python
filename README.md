# High-Level Programming with Python

Welcome to my repository **high-level-programming-Python**. This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering Python programming. It contains notes, exercises, and projects that I have worked on throughout my learning process.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

This folder contains all the material from the "100 Days of Python Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

- **`notes`**: Summarized notes from each day of the bootcamp.
- **`exercises`**: Coding exercises and challenges tackled during the bootcamp.
- **`projects`**: Larger projects that demonstrate the application of concepts learned.

### 2. `python4all`

This folder contains materials from the "Python for Everybody (PY4E)" course by Dr. Chuck, including the book by Dr. Chuck.

- **`notes`**: My personal and summarized notes from the lectures and readings.
- **`exercises`**: Practice exercises and coding tasks assigned during the course.
- **`projects`**: Comprehensive projects built to apply the skills acquired.
